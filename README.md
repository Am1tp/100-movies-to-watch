#### What is this project?
A small project built to test webscraping with BeautifulSoup.
The following url ("https://web.archive.org/web/20200518073855/https://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/best-movies-2/") is used to scrape the titles of the
movies from the 'The 100 Best Movies Of All Time' article, then save each title in a txt document in the same working directory as main.py, under the 
name 'movies_list.txt'. If a file with this name does not exist, one will be created, otherwise the exisiting file will have its data overwritten.

#### How to run:
Run the file main.py

#### Future improvements/ideas
- Create a GUI to run the programme
- Filters to customise the scraping of movies e.g. by number of movies to scrape, genre, year, leading actor etc
- Find links for streaming/rental options for each title
